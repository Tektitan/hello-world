The beginning.

June 29th 2021;

It was a hot day in Sasebo, Japan. Living and working on the USS Ashland, which could be described as a crocpot and I a delicacy in troussing. Confined to do what I am told, due to the contract I signed after being basted with sweet lies about the life as a sailor. I am sure many of us who once served will agree. Regardless, I am thankful for the time of my service. Yes, even for the moments of utter disgust and undelights. And now, instead of looking for a remedy in the bottom of a bottle or in the bosom of some femme fatale... I have found my cure, a passion that allows me to look forward to the future. Better yet acts as a mise en place for my future; Computer Science! I see myself as an accomplished developer. One of the many that bring the world one step closer to a pure utopia, living symbiotically with our planet(or planets?). And lastly, I would like to say that I am very, very hungry.

Thank You
